= Introduction =

Project uses Maven integration, ADT and Eclipse 3.7. To use Eclipse, you need to setup m2e, subclipse, install Subversion native libraries from http://www.open.collab.net/downloads/community/.
After you set things up, use "import->maven->from scm", type address "http://anusai-android.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/webclient". After the project successfully imported into workspace, do same for address "http://anusai-android.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Anusai.android".

If you wish to simply check out code without intergration, follow google code's instructions.
